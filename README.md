# Completed Ripley autopilot system:

This is the first attempt to to combine all layers and build the completed autopilot firmware. 

The integrated layers are:
* Perception Layer: Provides environmental awareness and state estimation, feeding data to the flight controller and mission control.
* Flight Control Layer: Processes sensor data, executes flight modes, and sends actuator commands.
* Mission Control Layer: Communicates with the ground control station (GCS) via MAVLink, receiving commands and sending telemetry.
* UI Layer: Displays telemetry, camera feed, and allows user input for flight mode changes and control.

1. Integration strategy:
* Data Flow:
  * The DronePerceptionSystem updates the drone's state and environmental data, which is passed to the FlightController for control decisions and to the MissionCommunicationLayer for telemetry.
  * The MissionCommunicationLayer receives commands (e.g., waypoints, mode changes) and passes them to the FlightController or updates the mission plan.
  * The DroneAutopilotGUI displays telemetry and camera feeds, and sends user commands (e.g., mode changes, altitude) to the FlightController.

* Threading: Each layer runs in its own thread to ensure non-blocking operation, with synchronized data access using thread-safe mechanisms.
* MAVLink Integration: The mission control layer uses MAVLink to communicate with a GCS or simulator, mapping commands to the flight controller's API.
* Simulation Support: The system can operate with mock sensors/actuators for testing or real hardware interfaces.

2. Initialization:
* The AutopilotSystem initializes all layers: perception (DronePerceptionSystem), flight control (FlightController), mission communication (MissionCommunicationLayer), and UI (DroneAutopilotGUI).
* It supports both mock interfaces (for simulation) and placeholders for real hardware interfaces.

3. Data Flow:
* The perception system updates the drone's state (DroneState) and environmental data, which is converted to the flight controller's FlightState format (e.g., Vector3, Attitude).
* Telemetry data (position, altitude, battery, etc.) is sent to the mission communication layer for GCS transmission and to the GUI for display.
* The GUI's user inputs (e.g., flight mode changes, altitude) are mapped to FlightController commands.

4. MAVLink Command Handling:
* The handle_mavlink_command method translates MAVLink commands (e.g., MAV_CMD_NAV_TAKEOFF, MISSION_ITEM) into FlightController actions (e.g., setting modes, adding waypoints).
* Waypoints received as MISSION_ITEM messages are converted to the Waypoint format used by the flight controller.

5. hreading:
* Separate threads run the perception update, control loop, and UI to ensure real-time performance.
* A threading lock (self.lock) synchronizes access to shared data (e.g., FlightController state).

6. Safety and Shutdown:
* The system handles graceful shutdown via stop(), disarming the flight controller, stopping the mission communication, and closing the UI.
* The UI's on_closing method triggers the system shutdown when the window is closed.
