# Flight Controller layer:

Flight control layer is designed to manage low-level control of the drone’s hardware to execute commands and maintain stable flight. This layer receives commands from the mission control layer and sensor data from the perception layer; sends feedback on the drone’s state to higher layers. The figure below shows the proposed flight control layer architecture.

This layer has following key functionalities: 
* Translates high-level commands (e.g., “fly to waypoint X”) from the mission control 
layer into specific actuator inputs (e.g., motor speeds, control surface adjustments). 
* Maintains stability and precise control during flight using feedback from sensors (e.g., 
gyroscopes, accelerometers). 
* Implements control algorithms (e.g., PID controllers) to adjust for disturbances like wind 
or turbulence. 
* Executes maneuvers such as takeoff, landing, hovering, or waypoint following. 

Also, key characteristics include Operates in real-time with high precision, focusing on 
hardware-level control and rapid response to dynamic conditions.
