# USER INTERFACE LEAYER:

This is the most external layer and closest layer to user. This layer is primarilty built to interact with user to observe and interact with input and output data in drone operations. 

The most popular open-source drone autopilot firmware is Ardupilot. 

1. interface layer:

This is the most external layer in the proposed architecture. The major purpose of this layer is to
interact with user directly as the user interface in ground station. This layer has several features
for user to interact with input and output data and interact with drone itself.

The basic data features include:
• Map
• Telemetry data
• Position
• Battery level
• GPS indicator
• Flight mode
• Alert/notifications
• Speed
• Primary flight display

Beside these basic data features, Ripley is also included with advanced data analytics tools. The primary data analytic technology is computer vision. Ripley is directly connected to Drone camera units. User can directly check Drone POV (point of view) in real time for self-decision making.
Another major development is the real-time output data display unit. This is essential for autonomous operations. 

These output data types include:
• Object detection
• Obstacle detection
• Object tracking
• Distance measurement
• Target tracking
• Operational status
