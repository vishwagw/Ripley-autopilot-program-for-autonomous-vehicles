# mission control layer for Ripley:

This is the central layer or 'brain' layer unit of the autopilot system. The mission control layer is a high-level self decision making layer structure that is responsible for planning, coordnating, and overseeing the drone mission execution with advanced functionalities. 

The mission control layer is the high-level decision-making component responsible for planning, 
coordinating, and overseeing the execution of a drone's mission. This is the most important layer of the firmware architecture. This layer act as the brain unit of entire firmware by translating user-defined objectives into actionable commands while ensuring safe and efficient operation.

## There are several key functionalities in the mission control layer. They include:

1. Mission planning: 
• Interprets mission objectives (e.g., waypoint navigation, area mapping, or payload delivery) provided by the user or external systems. 
• Generates a flight plan, including waypoints, altitudes, speeds, and specific tasks (e.g.: capturing images, dropping payloads). 
• Optimizes routes based on factors like distance, battery life, no-fly zones, and environmental conditions.

2. Task coordination: 
• Sequences and prioritizes tasks during the mission, such as navigation, sensor activation, or communication with ground stations. 
• Manages transitions between mission phases (e.g., takeoff, cruise, landing). 

3. Interface with other layers: 
• Communicates with the flight control layer to send commands (e.g., adjust speed, altitude, or heading) and receive feedback on the drone’s state (e.g., position, orientation). 
• Integrates with the perception layer to process sensor data (e.g., GPS, LiDAR, cameras) for situational awareness and obstacle avoidance. 
• Interfaces with communication systems to relay status updates to ground control or receive new instructions. 

4. Real-time decision making: 
• Monitors mission progress and environmental data (e.g., weather, obstacles, battery levels) to make dynamic adjustments. 
• Responds to contingencies, such as rerouting to avoid obstacles, returning to base on low battery, or aborting the mission if unsafe conditions are detected.

5. Ensure the safety measures: 
• Enforces safety protocols, such as geofencing, collision avoidance, and adherence to regulatory constraints (e.g., airspace restrictions). 
• Executes fail-safe procedures, like returning to home (RTH) or emergency landing, in case of system failures or loss of communication. 

## The mission control layer contains following characteristics:

• High-Level Abstraction: Operates at a strategic level, focusing on mission objectives rather than low-level control (handled by the flight control layer). 
• Modularity: Designed to be flexible, allowing integration with various drone types, payloads, and mission types. 
• Autonomy: Capable of independent decision-making based on pre-programmed rules, machine learning models, or real-time data analysis. 
• User Interaction: Often interfaces with a ground control station (GCS) or app, enabling users to define missions, monitor progress, or intervene if needed. 

## Designing the mission control layer:

To build a mission communication layer in Python for an autonomous drone autopilot system, you need to create a component that handles data exchange between the drone and external systems (e.g., ground control station, cloud, or other drones). This layer is responsible for transmitting telemetry, receiving mission commands, and ensuring reliable communication.

## Approach:

There are few procdures for building a mission control layer. 

1. Choose a Communication Protocol:
* Use MAVLink (Micro Air Vehicle Link), a lightweight header-only messaging protocol designed for drones. It supports telemetry, commands, and mission updates.
* Alternatives include custom TCP/UDP sockets or MQTT, but MAVLink is standard for autopilots.

2. Select a Python Library:
* Use pymavlink, a Python library for MAVLink communication, which simplifies sending and receiving MAVLink messages.

3. Define Key Functionalities:

* Telemetry Transmission: Send drone state (e.g., position, battery, status) to the ground control station (GCS).
* Command Reception: Receive and process mission commands (e.g., waypoints, takeoff, land) from the GCS.
* Heartbeat Mechanism: Maintain a connection with the autopilot by sending periodic heartbeats.
* Reliable Communication: Handle connection losses and ensure message integrity.

4. Implement the Layer:
* Create a class to manage the communication loop, message parsing, and command execution.
* Integrate with the mission control layer by passing received commands and providing telemetry feedback.

5. Test the System:
* Use a simulator (e.g., SITL with ArduPilot) or a real drone to test the communication layer.

## Explanation of the Code:

* Class Structure: MissionCommunicationLayer encapsulates all communication functionality, making it modular and reusable.
* MAVLink Connection: Uses pymavlink to connect over UDP (e.g., to a simulator or real autopilot). The connection string can be adjusted (e.g., serial for hardware).
* Heartbeat: Sends periodic heartbeats to keep the connection alive and signal the drone’s status.
* Telemetry: Sends position (latitude, longitude, altitude) and battery status to the GCS at regular intervals.
* Command Handling: Listens for COMMAND_LONG (e.g., takeoff, land) and MISSION_ITEM (waypoints) messages, passing them to a callback for the mission control layer to process.
* Threading: Runs heartbeat, telemetry, and command reception in separate threads to ensure non-blocking operation.
* Callback Mechanism: Allows the mission control layer to receive and process commands via a user-defined callback.
