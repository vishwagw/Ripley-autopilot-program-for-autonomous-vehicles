in this program, we are using python dronekit library for the code. 
dronekit is python library that can create a applications / programs that can control drone movements using python progrsmming language.
advanced program can be use o create an autonomous drone system.
can be used in D.I.Y drones nd autopilot systems such as ardupilot. 

requirements :-

1/. libraries :
dronekit 
time
argparse
exception
socket

2/. drone - based on raspberry-pi flight computer and pixhawk flight controller
(can also use Navio flight controller.)

#every step is describe on the code as notes, so anyone can understand easily.
when you running the program you have to connect the program to the drone through local host IP address.
run this command in the terminal - python movements.py --connect 127.0.0.1:**port number which drone is listening**
