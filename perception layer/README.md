# Perception layer of the Ripley autopilot system:

The perception layer is similar to mission control layer yet have different motives. The major purpose of perception layer is to Collects, processes, and interprets data from sensors to provide situational awareness and environmental understanding. This layer is Feeding processed data to the mission control layer for decision-making and to the flight control layer for navigation and stabilization. 

The key functionalities of the perception layer include: 
• Gathers data from sensors like GPS, cameras, LiDAR, ultrasonic sensors, radar, and 
IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units). 
• Performs sensor fusion to combine data from multiple sources for accurate localization 
and mapping (e.g., SLAM - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). 
• Detects and tracks objects, obstacles, or landmarks in the environment. 
• Estimates the drone’s state (position, orientation, velocity) and environmental conditions 
(e.g., wind speed, terrain). 

The major characteristics of this layer include Relies on real-time data processing, computer vision, and sometimes machine learning for object recognition and scene understanding. 

## Overview of the drone preception layer:

This implementation provides a comprehensive framework that includes:

1. Sensor Data Acquisition - Handles data collection from multiple sensors including cameras, LiDAR, radar, ultrasonic sensors, IMU, and GPS
2. Object Detection and Tracking - Identifies and tracks objects in the environment over time
3. Environmental Mapping - Creates a 3D occupancy grid of the environment to identify free and occupied space
4. Sensor Fusion - Combines data from multiple sensors to create a unified understanding of the drone's state
5. Situation Awareness - Analyzes environmental data to assess threats and safety conditions

## Key features of this layer:

The system supports a wide variety of sensors that would be found on an advanced drone:

* Cameras for visual perception
* LiDAR for precise distance measurements and mapping
* Radar for long-range detection in various weather conditions
* Ultrasonic sensors for close-range obstacle detection
* IMU for orientation and movement sensing
* GPS for global positioning

## Object Detection and Persistence
The object tracking system maintains persistent identities of detected objects across frames, calculating their trajectories and velocities - essential for predicting their future positions and avoiding collisions.
## 3D Environmental Mapping
The system builds a 3D occupancy grid of the environment, identifying free, occupied, and unknown space. This is crucial for path planning and obstacle avoidance.
## Robust State Estimation
Using Kalman filtering, the system fuses data from multiple sensors to create a reliable estimate of the drone's position, orientation, and velocity - even if individual sensors occasionally provide inaccurate data.
## Danger Assessment
The situation awareness module continuously evaluates the environment to identify potential threats, assigning a danger level that can be used by the control system to make safety-critical decisions.
